# Face-Sketch-Construction-and-Recognition-for-Forensic
This project aims to provide a standalone platform for constructing forensic face sketches and recognizing suspects without requiring a forensic artist. The system enables users to create accurate face sketches using a drag-and-drop interface and matches them against a criminal database using deep learning-based face recognition.
